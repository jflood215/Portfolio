# Developer Portfolio

This portfolio was created during my 6 month bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy and has since been updated many, many times. The purpose of this website is to display some of the projects I've created over the past 1+ years, to show the different technologies that I have experience with, and to demonstrate my skills and passion to friends, family, and potential employers.

Thanks for visiting, and have a great day.
